<h3>Keynote 1: Big Data, Deep Learning, and other Allegories: Scalability and Fault-tolerance of Parallel and Distributed Infrastructures</h3>


	<b>Speaker:</b>
	<br>
	Divyakant Agrawal
	<br>
	Director of Research, Data Analytics, Qatar Computing Research Institute
<br>&
<br>
Professor of Computer Science, University of California at Santa Barbara

	  <br> <br>
	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>Big data has emerged as one of the most promising technology paradigm in the past few years. Availability of large data arises in numerous application contexts: trillions of words in English and other languages, hundreds of billions of text documents, a large number of translations of documents in one language to other languages, billions of images and videos along with textual annotations and summaries, thousands of hours of speech recordings, trillions of log records capturing human activity, and the list goes on. During the past decade, careful processing and analysis of different types of data has had transformative effect. Many applications that were buried in the pages of science fiction have become a reality, e.g., driverless cars, language agnostic conversation, automated image understanding, and most recently deep learning to simulate a human brain. In the technology context, Big Data has resulted in significant research and development challenges. From a systems perspective, scalable storage, retrieval, processing, analysis, and management of data poses the biggest challenge. From an application perspective, leveraging large amounts of data to develop models of physical reality becomes a complex problem. The interesting dichotomy is that the bigness of data in the system context makes some of the known data processing solutions that were “acceptable” to “not acceptable.” For example, standard algorithms for carrying out join processing may have to be revisited in the Big Data context. In contrast, the bigness of data allows many applications to move from being “not possible” to “possible”. For example real time, automated, high quality and robust language translation seems entirely feasible leveraging large amounts of translation data. Thus, new approaches are warranted to develop scalable technologies for processing and managing Big Data. In the same vein, designing and developing robust models for learning from big data remains a significant research challenge. We explore the Big Data problem both from the system perspective as well as from the application perspective. In the popular press, “bigness” or the size of data is touted as a desirable property. Our goal is to clearly comprehend the underlying complexity that must be overcome with the increasing size of data and clearly delineate the challenges and opportunities in this fast developing space.</p>

From January 2006 through December 2007, Dr. Agrawal served as VP of Data Solutions and Advertising Systems at the Internet Search Company ASK.com. Dr. Agrawal has also served as a Visiting Senior Research Scientist at the NEC Laboratories of America in Cupertino, CA from 1997 to 2009 and as a Visiting Scientist in the Advertising Infrastructure Group at Google, Inc. in Mountain View, CA in 2013-2014. During his professional career, Dr. Agrawal has served on numerous Program Committees of International Conferences, Symposia, and Workshops and served as an editor of the journal of Distributed and Parallel Databases (1993-2008), the VLDB journal (2003-2008), and IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (2012-2014). He currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief of Distributed and Parallel Databases and is on the editorial boards of the ACM Transactions on Database Systems and ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems. He serves on the Board of Trustees of the VLDB Endowment and has served on the Executive Committee of ACM Special Interest Group SIGSPATIAL. 
	  <br>
	  Dr. Agrawal's research philosophy is to develop data management solutions that are theoretically sound and are relevant in practice. He has published more than 350 research manuscripts in prestigious forums (journals, conferences, symposia, and workshops) on wide range of topics related to data management and distributed systems and has advised more than 35 Doctoral students during his academic career. He received the 2011 Outstanding Graduate Mentor Award from the Academic Senate at UC Santa Barbara. Dr. Agrawal has been recognized as an Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Distinguished Scientist in 2010 and was inducted as an ACM Fellow in 2012. He has also been inducted as a Fellow of IEEE in 2012. In 2015, Dr. Agrawal and his co-authors received the International Conference on Database Theory Test-of-Time award. His current interests are in the area of scalable data management and data analysis in Cloud Computing environments, security and privacy of data in the cloud, and scalable analytics over big data. </p>

<h3>Keynote 2: Fast Data and the Imperative for Human Understanding and Control</h3>
	<b>Speaker:</b> 
	<br>
	Richard Tibbetts
	<br>CTO at StreamBase Systems
	  <br> <br>
	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>Fast Data, the timely processing of big data in order to make 
	  decisions in real-time with the best available information, is receiving 
	  a great deal of attention from both media and business stakeholders. Data-rich 
	  real-time automation has the potential to improve efficiency and human experience 
	  across an enormous range of activities: manufacturing processes to public 
	  transit, logistics to healthcare, financial markets to retail. For all of these 
	  scenarios, we’ll look at opportunities to combine streaming analytics and machine 
	  learning with automated decision-making and integrated business processes. The 
	  research community has focused on software and communications architectures to 
	  support these applications, and there remain many open problems, but equally 
	  important is helping stakeholders — consumers, operators, or business owners — understand 
	  and control these systems. Keeping users aware and in control requires tradeoffs in 
	  architecture and analytics and an understanding of human factors and critical safety 
	  systems; Otherwise, we risk automated systems running wild, or a reactive regulatory 
	  regime hampering adoption of our innovations.</p>

<h3>Keynote 3: Workplace 2.0 - applying machine learning to event streams across cloud based collaboration services</h3>


	<b>Speaker:</b> 
	<br>
	Bjørn Olstad
	<br>Corporate Vice President at Microsoft, Norway
	  <br> <br>
	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>The talk will present the core architectural principles and challenges associated with building the Office Graph service. Office Graph consumes event streams across email, chat, social, authoring as well as 3rd party services. These event streams are processed with machine learning to form a derived data model in Office Graph representing all digital entities and how they relate based on the aggregated activity stream analysis. Events will modify the Office Graph both directly in realtime as well as indirectly by triggering analysis across events streams that finally write derived insights into the Office Graph data model. Privacy is a key topic that has been carefully modelled. As a result Office Graph forms a realtime data model capturing the insights across the event streams and offers this as a resource to 1st party applications such as Delve and Outlook as well as 3rd party app development. The talk will present some of these insight driven experiences and how they leverage specific analytics and machine learning applied to the lower level activity streams.</p>
